How to Use the Text-to-Speech Dialogue Reader:

1. First, install the required library by running:
   pip install pyttsx3

2. Then run the script with:
   python read_dialogue.py

The script will read the math dialogues aloud, with appropriate pauses between lines.

Controls:
- The script will read through all dialogues automatically
- To stop at any time, press Ctrl+C in the terminal
- Each line will be displayed in the terminal as it's being read
- There are short pauses between lines to make it easier to follow

Features:
- Clear voice output at a comfortable speaking rate
- Visual feedback of the current line being read
- Automatic pauses between speakers for natural conversation flow
- Handles both dialogue lines and key concept summaries

Note: This script uses the default system text-to-speech voice. The voice quality will depend on your operating system's available voices.
