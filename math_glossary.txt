Math Terminology Glossary (Grade 3 Division & Multiplication)

1. Division Terms:
- Dividend: The number being divided (e.g., in 56 รท 8 = 7, 56 is the dividend)
- Divisor: The number we divide by (e.g., in 56 รท 8 = 7, 8 is the divisor)
- Unknown Factor: The missing number in a division equation (e.g., in 72 รท ? = 9, 8 is the unknown factor)

2. Array Terms:
- Array: An arrangement of objects in rows and columns
- Row: A horizontal line of objects in an array
- Column: A vertical line of objects in an array
- Equal Groups: Groups that have the same number of objects

3. Problem-Solving Contexts:
- Equal Sharing: Dividing objects equally among a number of groups or people
- Equal Grouping: Making groups with the same number of objects
- Arrays in Division: Using rows and columns to organize and divide objects

4. Visual Models:
- Rectangular Arrays: Objects arranged in rows and columns forming a rectangle
- Equal Groups Model: Objects separated into groups with the same amount in each

5. Common Problem Types:
- Sharing Problems: Dividing a total amount equally among a number of groups
- Grouping Problems: Finding how many groups can be made with a given amount
- Array Problems: Using rows and columns to solve division problems
- Missing Factor Problems: Finding an unknown number in a division equation

Note: This terminology is used consistently in word problems and mathematical expressions to help students understand division concepts through real-world situations and visual models.
