    <div class="dialogue">
        <h2>Lesson 1: Multiplication as Repeated Addition</h2>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> Hey Maya, I'm confused about these multiplication problems. What does 4 × 3 really mean?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Oh, let me help! Think of it like this - we have two machines: one machine is 4 and the other machine is 3.</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> Machines?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Yes! When these machines work together, the first machine (4) tells us how many groups, and the second machine (3) tells us how many are in each group.</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> So 4 × 3 means...?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> It means add 3 four times! Like 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12</div>
        <div class="note">Key concept: Multiplication is repeated addition where machines (factors) work together</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <h2>Lesson 2: Multiplication and Groups</h2>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> I see cookies arranged in groups. How can machines help here?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Look, we have 3 plates (that's our first machine), and each plate has 4 cookies (that's our second machine).</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> Oh! So the machines tell us how to organize things?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Exactly! The first machine (3) organizes how many groups, and the second machine (4) decides how many go in each group.</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> So 3 × 4 means 3 groups of 4!</div>
        <div class="note">Key concept: Machines help organize objects into equal groups</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <h2>Lesson 3: Arrays and Multiplication</h2>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> These rows and columns look like a pattern. How do machines work here?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> The machines are like architects! The first machine builds the rows, and the second machine builds the columns.</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> So in a 5 × 3 array...</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> The first machine (5) creates 5 rows, and the second machine (3) puts 3 items in each row!</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> That makes arrays easier to understand!</div>
        <div class="note">Key concept: Machines build arrays by controlling rows and columns</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <h2>Lesson 4: Division and Machines</h2>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> How do machines work in division?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> In division, we know the total and one of the machines, and we need to find the other machine!</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> Like in 12 ÷ 3?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Yes! We have 12 items total, and one machine is 3. We need to find out how many groups of 3 we can make.</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> So we're looking for the missing machine that works with 3 to make 12!</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Exactly! And 12 ÷ 3 = 4 because 3 × 4 = 12</div>
        <div class="note">Key concept: Division finds a missing machine when we know the total and one machine</div>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <h2>Lesson 5: Properties of Multiplication</h2>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> Does it matter which machine goes first?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> That's a great question! The cool thing about machines is they can switch places!</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> You mean 3 × 4 is the same as 4 × 3?</div>
        <div class="student2"><strong>Maya:</strong> Yes! Whether the first machine is 3 and the second is 4, or vice versa, they still work together to make 12.</div>
        <div class="student1"><strong>Alex:</strong> That makes multiplication more flexible!</div>
        <div class="note">Key concept: Machines can switch places (commutative property)</div>
